# PickPocket

PickPocket is an app based on the game [Mastermind](ultimate-mastermind-rules.pdf). Players try to guess the correct combination of numbers to crack a lock. After each guess, players are given feedback on the number of digits in their guess that are correct or misplaced. The previous guesses a player made and and results of those guesses are also displayed. Players can either play against the computer, or try to crack the locks of other players.

## Getting Started
Check out this [link](https://docs.google.com/a/intrepid.io/document/d/1Wywului461Y45yPI0grVbXJd6oj6FukvSLCbRmFJaLw/edit?usp=sharing), which describes the game logic in more detail.

## Project Overview:

Pickpocket is designed to be completed in incremental steps, listed below. Each step adds functionality to the project, and the steps should be completed in order. Remember that this is not a race or competition. We would prefer you complete a few sections using proper architecture and coding style rather than rush through the project but end up with a tangled web of untestable code. This is a learning experience.

For each step below, you should put up at least one pull request containing the changes you made to implement the step. A pull request (PR) is a way of notifying other members of your team that you've made some changes that you want to merge. PRs should not include more than one step, and multiple PRs can be made for per step if there are a lot of changes. Your mentor will help you put up your first PR. They will also review your PRs. In PR reviews, your mentor will provide feedback on how to make your code better and how to adhere to Intrepid's best practices and style guide. After making the suggested changes and getting your mentor's approval, you will merge your PR and move onto the next step.

## Steps
0. [Hello, World](steps/step-0.md) - Fork and clone the PickPocket repo and update the `README`
1. [Create Models](steps/step-1.md) - Create models that encapsulate the game logic.
1. [Create UI](steps/step-2.md) - Create a UI that allows you to play a one-way Mastermind game against a computer opponent.
1. [Create View Model](steps/step-3.md) - Connect the UI to the model using a view model and add a list of previous guesses.
1. [Networking](steps/step-4.md) - Add a networking class that allows you to crack a remote lock using an API.

## Next Steps
If you finish the steps given above, go talk to the person running the project or to your mentor about next steps.
